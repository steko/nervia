This is a Django project (`nervia`) and app (`magazzino`)
to manage a physical storage space for archaeological finds.

It is being developed in-house at the archaeological museum
of ancient Albintimilium. It will likely be deployed on a local
network.

Current target dependencies are Django 1.5 and Python 2.7.
